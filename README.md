## 📝 Development Log

- **Day 1 (Nov 23):** Welcome, Sign In, and Onboarding screens completed. Navigation working.
- **Day 2 (Nov 24):** Onboarding screens polished, Result preview screen created (WIP), project structure setup
- **Day 3 (Nov 25):** 
- Completed results preview screen with LinearGradient fade effect. 
- Created reusable FloatingLabelInput component for label transitions
- Implemented floating labels on Sign In and Sign Up screens,
- Added navigationglow: Sign In -> Onboarding and Sign up -> Sign In
- **Day 4 (Nov 26):**
- Fixed FloatingLabelInput rendering on mobile using zIndex
- Fixed spacing and polishing of all screens on mobile
- **Day 6 (Nov 27):**
- Firebase authenticator implementation on Sign-in (using email and password validation) and Sign-up (username stored in firebase) screen.
- There was a major bug that I encountered. "Component auth has not been registered yet". Even with simple web SDK config, so I tried using lazy loading method, which broke the export. The fix was to download a more stable & older version of firebase (10.13.2) and used simple web SDK config, approx time to fix  3 hours.
- **Day 8 (Nov 30):**
  - Created homepage with scrollable content and fixed navbar
  - Added calorie tracker section with progress bar placeholder
  - Added workout routine template display (Monday-Sunday split)
  - Implemented Instagram-style fixed bottom navigation
- **Day 9 (Dec 1):**
  - Added protected route to prevent unauthorised access
- **Day 10 (Dec 2):**
  - Added exercise database of 89 exercises each exercise includes:
    - Primary, Secondary, and Tertiary Muscle Groups.
    - Type of equipment (Machine,Barbell,Dumbbell,Bodyweight)
    - Strength or Hypertrophy focused
    - Compound or Isolation focused

- **Day 11 (Dec 3):**
- Added pseudocode for workout generation algorithm:
  - 2 days per week:
    - Less than 30 mins
  
- **Day 12 (Dec 5)**
- Finished all version of 2 days per week psuedocode
- Made Day 11's pseudocode better and clearer
- Converted and stored 89 exercises from google sheets to firebase database

- **Day 13 (Dec 6) Session 1**
- Workout Generator for 2Days FB done
  - Fetch exercise from Firebase
  - Generate Day A and Day B workouts for 2 Days FB routine
  - Avoid equipment duplicates within the days
  - Avoid exercise duplictes across days
  - Created workout helper functions (checkTypeDupe1/2/3, checkRepeatedExercise)
  
- **Day 13 (Dec 6) Session 2**
- Built template-driven workout generator architecture
- Built UPPER_LOWER_TEMPLATES for all 3 durations (30/45/60+ min)
- Implemented core generator infrastructure:
  - fetchExercise() - Firebase integration
  - getOnboardingData() - user preference retrieval
  - generatorDay() - single day workout generation with week-dependent logic
